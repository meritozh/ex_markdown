## Goal

Make a intuitive markdown parser with many extensions I want.

This is not 100% compatible with [CommonMark specification](https://github.github.com/gfm), because I want keep the logic simple. The goal of specification is be compatibility and unambiguous, so there are many detail constrait that we actually won't meet.
